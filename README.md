# SignLanguage

## Description

Developed a model to recognize sign language alphabets from the MNIST sign language dataset on kaggle.
Using a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) made using Keras, I was able to achieve high accuracies on both the validation and test datasets.
The model was run on a Tesla K80 GPU on a Kaggle kernel.
Since the letters J and Z are gesture letters ie they require the motion of the hand, those were excluded from the experiment.
